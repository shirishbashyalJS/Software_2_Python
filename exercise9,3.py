# Again, extend the program by adding a new drive method that receives the number of hours as
#  a parameter. The method increases the travelled distance by how much the car has travelled in constant
#  speed in the given time. Example: The travelled distance of car object is 2000 km. The current speed is
#  60 km/h. Method call car.drive(1.5) increases the travelled distance to 2090 km.
