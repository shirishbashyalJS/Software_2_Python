# Implement the following class hierarchy using Python: A publication can be either a book or a magazine. 
# Each publication has a name. Each book also has an author and a page count, whereas each magazine has a chief
#  editor. Also write the required initializers to both classes. Create a print_information method to both 
# subclasses for printing out all information of the publication in question. In the main program, create 
# publications Donald Duck (chief editor Aki Hyyppä) and Compartment No. 6 (author Rosa Liksom, 192 pages).
#  Print out all information of both publications using the methods you implemented.

magazine = Magazine("Donald Duck", "Aki Hyyppä")
book = Book("Compartment No. 6", "Rosa Liksom", 192)
