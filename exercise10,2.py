# Extend the previous program by creating a Building class. The initializer parameters for the class are the
#  numbers of the bottom and top floors and the number of elevators in the building. When a building is created,
#  the building creates the required number of elevators. The list of elevators is stored as a property of the
#  building. Write a method called run_elevator that accepts the number of the elevator and the destination floor
#  as its parameters. In the main program, write the statements for creating a new building and running the elevators
#  of the building.
