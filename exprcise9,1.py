# Write a Car class that has the following properties: registration
#  number, maximum speed, current speed and travelled distance. Add
#  a class initializer that sets the first two of the properties based on parameter
#  values. The current speed and travelled distance of a new car must be automatically
#  set to zero. Write a main program where you create a new car (registration number
#  ABC-123, maximum speed 142 km/h). Finally, print out all the properties of the new
#  car.

from Class.class9 import Car 

car1 = Car("ABC-123", 142)
print(f"Car's Registration Number: {car1.reg_num}, Maximum Speed = {car1.max_speed}, Current Spped = {car1.cur_speed} and Total Distance Travelled = {car1.distance}")
